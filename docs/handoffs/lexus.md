## Beat 1 — Project stood up, five formats decoded, repository published

**2026-07-27 14:50 CEST (UTC+02:00)**

### Entry state

A Sonic 4 Episode II PC Beta 8 install with WamWooWam's Episode I decompilation
sitting beside it, and a directive to produce something in the same vein for
Episode II, for preservation and to run on phones.

### What was established

**The premise had to be corrected first.** Episode I is decompilable only because
of its Windows Phone 7 build — WP7 banned native code, so it shipped as managed
.NET and ILSpy can recover near-source C#. Episode II never shipped on such a
platform. Windows, PS3, 360, iOS, Android, Ouya and Shield are all native C++,
and the announced Windows Phone port was cancelled. `Sonic.exe` is native x86
from VS2008 with no PDB, no game-code RTTI (`/GR-`), and `/LTCG` across 663 of
757 objects. VERIFIED — no CLR references anywhere in the binary.

So this is a **re-implementation guided by reverse engineering**, not a
decompilation, and the documentation says so plainly rather than overselling it.

**What makes it tractable:** both games run SEGA's AliceNN engine. Episode II's
binary leaks `e:\sega\sonic4ep2-beta\program\library\alicenn\...` through an
assert, and Episode I's decompilation contains that same engine in readable C#.
Episode I is used as a **behavioural oracle** — read it to learn what something
means, then write our own code and verify against Episode II's bytes.

### Formats decoded, all verified against the entire build

| Format | Result |
|--------|--------|
| AMB archives | 1614/1614 parse, extraction lossless |
| Stage tile grids `.MP`/`.MD` | 400/400 grids resolve exactly |
| Object placement `.EV` | 65/65 parse; `.DC`=4B, `.RG`=2B strides |
| Texture banks `.TXB` | 651/651, every name resolves to a real DDS |
| NN containers `.ZNO`/`.ZNM`/`.ZNV` | 5727/5727, census matches extensions exactly |

Supporting findings: `.MP` cells are a bitfield (id:12, rot:2, flip_h, flip_v)
confirmed on 512,070 cells; `.EV` blocks index the map at quarter resolution on a
256px pitch; textures are plain DXT1/3/5 with no wrapper; all 1,843 shaders are
Shader Model 3.0 bytecode, which is MojoShader's input format.

**The most consequential finding:** stage tile ids are **indices into a per-zone
archive of 3D models**, not sprite references. Verified on all 13 act maps,
usually an exact fit. Episode II's stages are grids of 3D model instances, so a
stage viewer needs an NN geometry parser rather than a tile blitter. The name
histogram makes it obvious in hindsight — Zone 1 Act 1 places `Z1_G_FL_A.ZNO`
(floor) 12,552 times and `Z1_G_HASIRA_B.ZNO` (柱, pillar) 2,458 times.

### Two bugs worth remembering

**Silent data loss in extraction.** The first extractor dropped ~25% of stage
geometry because map archives carry blank string-table slots that all collapsed
onto one output filename. Caught by reconciling written-file counts against files
on disk, not by anything failing. Fixed by falling back to the entry index.

**`.gitignore` case-matching.** Banning `*.MD` for map data silently swallowed
every `.md` document on Windows, so the initial commit staged 4 of 12 files.
Ignores are now directory-scoped with a warning comment.

Both are the same class of failure: something that looks like it worked.

### Repository

Public at **https://github.com/Hawaiiiiii/Sonic4Episode2**, branch `main`,
6 commits. Tools and documentation only — no game assets, ever. README written in
the spirit of Episode I Deluxe's, crediting **WamWooWam** for that decompilation
and **TGEnigma** for the original, plus Hidden Palace and Obscure Gamers for
prototype preservation.

### Correction accepted this beat

Yondaime pushed back on a multi-year estimate and was right. The engine layer is
genuinely derisked by Episode I; the long pole is Episode II's own game content.
A playable Zone 1 Act 1 needs the engine, the player, and the **49 distinct object
ids** that act actually uses — not all ~6,600 game functions. Revised: viewer in
weeks, engine booting in 2–4 months, one act playable in 6–12 months solo. Years
applies to the complete game only.

### Next

Decode the `NZOB` payload — node tree, materials, vertex and index buffers. Start
from `Z1_G_FL_A.ZNO`, whose object chunk is only 808 bytes. Respect `NOF0`: it is
a relocation table and its offsets need fixing up against the data chunk base.
Episode I's `NNS_OBJECT.Read` via `amObjectSetup` is the oracle.

### Open

`.EV` object ids have no name table — the ~298 names are immediates inside each
object's code, so they need rizin disassembly. `.AME` effects undecoded. The
MojoShader assumption underpinning the mobile target is unproven and should get a
spike before anything depends on it.

Wagata, Yondaime! Signed sincerely by your dear Lexus
